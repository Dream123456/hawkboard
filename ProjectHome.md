# Introduction #

The Hawkboard is a low-cost open platform for ARM 9 and C674x Floating Point DSP applications based on Texas Instruments' OMAP L 138.

This project, hosted on code.google.com, is meant to address the needs of HawkBoard users needing a reference starting point. Bugs on the website, board, and reference software are tracked here, as well as proving all of the reference/diagnostic software.
